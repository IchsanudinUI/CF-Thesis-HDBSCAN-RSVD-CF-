# CF-Thesis-HDBSCAN-RSVD-CF-
this repository is about my thesis project/research to create system recommendation model which I choose HDBCSAN clustering and RSVD dimension reduction


For the data that I use, you can access it through my Google Drive:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JSxvD8E9b0izy9YI9XPc6he8LH66OveX?usp=sharing

In this repository, I will present 4 of ipynb programs that I create in terms of my bachelor's thesis about system recommendation
with title:

"Penerapan HDBSCAN-Randomized SVD terhadap Permasalahan Sparsity dan Scalability di 
Collaborative Filtering untuk Rekomendasi Buku pada 
Perdagangan Elektronik"

or

Application of HDBSCAN-Randomized SVD to Sparsity and Scalability Problems in
Collaborative Filtering for Book Recommendations on
Electronic Commerce

Feel free to use it, and shout out to Amy@GrabNGoInfo to create the base of CF python code. You can also
try to visi their website (https://medium.com/grabngoinfo/recommendation-system-user-based-collaborative-filtering-a2e76e3e15c4)
and try the vanilla code by yourself for CF models only.


Please use the Revised ipynb, which is contain all 4 algorithm for models


you can also see my work (but it is little bit messy :ppp, haha..)
